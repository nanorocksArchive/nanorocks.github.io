            <h1>Give Your Ideas Away</h1>

            <small>March 17, 2016</small>

                        <p>I consult for a lot of entrepreneurs and founders. I help them out with marketing, strategy and a little coaching here and there. For the most part,
this is a great experience, and I get to help some awesome visionaries who are excited about what they’re doing.</p>
<p>But I get at least 2–3 emails a week from a founder who has something akin to <strong>“The Next Facebook”</strong> and wants me to sign an
NDA before she or he can tell me about it. You know, in case I steal it.</p>
